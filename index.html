                <p>Introducing Pikd, a TIS [Text, Image, and speech] converter that takes plain old text 
and turns it into an interactive slideshow of images and sound.
</p><p>
Motivations: There are many ways to experience information. Society for the most part 
has mainly encouraged text as a way of conveying information. This way of conveying 
information is very convenient and many people can appreciate its simplicity and power, 
however, increasingly it is becoming boring to read text. Videos and Images have often 
been the way to convey text in an interesting and captivating manner. While videos 
and images are great, there is way more text out there, and it would be really cool if 
there was something that made it more interesting. In addition, I was reading a book 
on improving memory and it claimed that the best way to remember something is to 
add more senses. When you read about a spoon, picture a spoon. Hearing the word 
said out loud also aids memory because more the senses are engaged. Pikd tries to do just that.</p>

                <p id="sample"><strong>Sample Input:</strong>A Story [Alice in wonderland] http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rgs/alice-table.html
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>
