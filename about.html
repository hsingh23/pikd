      <h1>About</h1>
<p>Introducing Pikd, a TIS [Text, Image, and speech] converter that takes plain old text and turns it into an interactive slideshow of images and sound. <br/> Motivations: There are many ways to experience information. Society for the most part has mainly encouraged text as a way of conveying information. This way of conveying information is very convenient and many people can appreciate its simplicity and power, however, increasingly it is becoming boring to read text. Videos and Images have often been the way to convey text in an interesting and captivating manner. While videos and images are great, there is way more text out there, and it would be really cool if there was something that made it more interesting. In addition, I was reading a book on improving memory and it claimed that the best way to remember something is to add more senses. When you read about a spoon, picture a spoon. Hearing the word said out loud also aids memory because more the senses are engaged. Pikd tries to do just that.</p>
